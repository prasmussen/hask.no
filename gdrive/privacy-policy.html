    <h1>Gdrive - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      Gdrive's privacy policy is to not share any user data and to not track anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gdrive accesses user data via the google drive api and is only visible to the user who has installed gdrive and is not shared with anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oauth access token to the drive api is stored in the .gdrive directory in the user's home directory. The token is never shared with anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gdrive app only communicates with google drive api and only anonymous usage data is visible in the google console to the creator of gdrive.
